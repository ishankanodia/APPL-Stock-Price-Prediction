Apple (AAPL) Stock Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock data. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to perform time series forecasting based on various stock indicators such as open, high, low, close, and volume.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a model capable of accurately forecasting Apple's stock price movements. Historical data from the Tiingo API is used to build and train the model. Various preprocessing steps are undertaken to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms, and the final results provide insights into the stock's future behavior.

Key Features:
Data Source: The project fetches stock data from Tiingo API. The dataset includes columns like open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted values for these metrics.
Data Visualization: The data is visualized using matplotlib and seaborn to observe trends and patterns over time.
Modeling Techniques: Time series forecasting methods are applied using deep learning frameworks like tensorflow.
Performance Metrics: The model’s predictions are evaluated based on accuracy and error metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
Data Collection
Data is collected using the Tiingo API for Apple Inc.'s stock prices, and the data includes:

Open: Price of the stock when trading starts for the day.
Close: Price of the stock when trading closes for the day.
High/Low: Highest and lowest prices of the stock during the day.
Volume: Number of shares traded.
Adjusted Values: Adjusted open, high, low, close, and volume considering dividends and stock splits.
The data spans a significant historical period, providing a solid foundation for training predictive models.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed:

Handling missing data.
Extracting relevant features (e.g., closing prices).
Normalization of data for training models effectively.
Train-test split to ensure robust evaluation of the model.
Model Implementation
Deep Learning Model:
A deep learning approach using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks is implemented to predict future stock prices. LSTM is chosen for its ability to capture dependencies in time series data.

Steps:
Data is split into training and test sets.
The LSTM model is built using TensorFlow and trained on the historical stock prices.
Model evaluation is done using metrics such as RMSE to assess prediction accuracy.
Results
The trained LSTM model provides predictions for Apple's future stock prices. Key insights from the model include:

Short-term trends in stock prices.
The model achieved a relatively low RMSE, indicating accurate predictions on test data.
Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices shows that the model captures the general trend of Apple’s stock price movements effectively.
The model can be further improved by tuning hyperparameters or experimenting with different architectures, but it already demonstrates strong predictive performance on Apple's historical stock data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in stock price prediction. By utilizing LSTM networks, the model provides valuable insights into future stock movements, which can be used as part of a larger strategy for trading or investment decision-making.
